  "name": "Rural Electrification Planning",
  "description": "A rural region in a developing country with 50,000 residents currently has limited access to electricity. Only 30% of households have grid connection, and frequent power outages affect economic development. The government has allocated funding to improve energy access and reliability. This decision involves selecting the most appropriate electrification strategy considering local resources, economic constraints, and community needs.",
