  "name": "Campus Energy Planning",
  "description": "A university campus with 15,000 students needs to upgrade its energy system to reduce costs and environmental impact. The campus currently spends $2.5 million annually on electricity and wants to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. This decision involves selecting the best energy solution for the campus's unique needs, considering academic schedules, budget constraints, and sustainability goals.",
