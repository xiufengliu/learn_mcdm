**Best for:** Intermediate students, sustainability courses, institutional decision-making

### 3. Rural Electrification Planning
**File:** `Rural_Electrification_Planning.json`
**Complexity:** Intermediate
**Context:** Development planning in rural areas

**Scenario:** A rural region in a developing country with 50,000 residents needs improved electricity access (currently only 30% have grid connection).

**Key Features:**
- 6 electrification alternatives (grid extension, mini-grids, solar home systems, etc.)
- 7 evaluation criteria emphasizing social and development factors
- Focus on appropriate technology and community impact
- Addresses energy access and development challenges

**Best for:** Development studies, appropriate technology courses, social impact analysis

## üéØ Learning Objectives

### Common Learning Goals:
- Apply MCDM methods to real-world energy decisions
- Understand trade-offs between economic, environmental, and social factors
- Practice stakeholder analysis and multi-objective optimization
- Develop critical thinking about energy policy and planning

### Method-Specific Applications:
- **SAW (Simple Additive Weighting):** Good for initial analysis and transparency
- **TOPSIS:** Excellent for comparing alternatives with ideal solutions
- **WPM (Weighted Product Method):** Useful for avoiding rank reversal issues
- **AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process):** Perfect for stakeholder-driven weight determination

## üìö How to Use These Problems

### For Instructors:

1. **Import the Problem:**
   - In the MCDM tool, click "üìù Manage" in the sidebar
   - Go to "üì• Export/Import" tab
   - Upload the JSON file or paste the content

2. **Customize for Your Course:**
   - Modify weights to reflect different stakeholder perspectives
   - Add or remove criteria based on learning objectives
   - Adjust data values to create different scenarios

3. **Teaching Sequence:**
   - Start with Campus Energy Planning (simplest)
   - Progress to Rural Electrification (development focus)
   - Finish with Regional Energy Planning (most complex)

4. **Discussion Questions:**
   Each problem includes built-in discussion points in the metadata

### For Students:

1. **Load and Explore:**
   - Import the problem and examine the alternatives and criteria
   - Understand the context and constraints
   - Review the data sources and assumptions

2. **Apply Different Methods:**
   - Try SAW first for intuitive understanding
   - Compare results with TOPSIS and WPM
   - Use AHP if stakeholder input is available

3. **Sensitivity Analysis:**
   - Change the weights to represent different stakeholder perspectives
   - Observe how rankings change
   - Identify robust alternatives that perform well under different scenarios

4. **Critical Analysis:**
   - Question the data and assumptions
   - Consider missing criteria or alternatives
   - Discuss implementation challenges

## üîÑ Customization Ideas

### Weight Variations:
- **Economic Focus:** Higher weights on cost criteria
- **Environmental Focus:** Emphasize emissions and environmental impact
- **Social Focus:** Prioritize job creation and community acceptance
- **Technical Focus:** Weight reliability and technical performance highly

### Scenario Modifications:
- Change budget constraints
- Add new alternatives (e.g., emerging technologies)
- Modify the timeline (urgent vs. long-term planning)
- Include policy constraints (e.g., renewable energy mandates)

### Extension Activities:
- Research real energy planning cases
- Interview local energy professionals
- Conduct stakeholder surveys for weight determination
- Perform economic analysis (NPV, payback period)
- Create implementation timelines

## üìä Expected Outcomes

### Typical Rankings (may vary with different weights):

**Regional Energy Planning:**
- Often favors: Natural Gas (short-term), Solar/Wind (long-term)
- Trade-offs: Nuclear (high output, low acceptance), Storage systems (high cost, high reliability)

**Campus Energy Planning:**
- Often favors: Energy Efficiency, Rooftop Solar
- Trade-offs: CHP (high savings, high cost), Wind (moderate performance)

**Rural Electrification:**
- Often favors: Solar Home Systems, Mini-Grid Solar
- Trade-offs: Grid Extension (high coverage, high cost), Micro-Hydro (high reliability, limited applicability)

## üéì Assessment Ideas

### Individual Assignments:
- Apply all four MCDM methods to one problem
- Compare and contrast the results
- Recommend the best alternative with justification

### Group Projects:
- Different groups represent different stakeholders
- Determine weights through group negotiation
- Present findings to the class

### Advanced Analysis:
- Perform sensitivity analysis on key parameters
- Research and propose additional alternatives
- Develop implementation plans for top-ranked alternatives

## üìñ Additional Resources

### Background Reading:
- Energy planning methodologies
- Renewable energy technologies
- Sustainable development goals
- Multi-stakeholder decision processes

### Real-World Cases:
- Denmark's renewable energy transition
- Rural electrification in Bangladesh
- Campus sustainability initiatives
- Municipal energy planning examples

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with fewer alternatives and criteria, then add complexity
2. **Use Real Data:** Encourage students to research actual costs and performance data
3. **Emphasize Process:** Focus on the decision-making process, not just the final ranking
4. **Encourage Debate:** Different stakeholders will legitimately prefer different alternatives
5. **Connect to Reality:** Relate results to actual energy planning decisions in the news

These problems provide a rich foundation for learning MCDM methods while addressing one of the most important challenges of our time: sustainable energy planning.
