  "name": "Regional Energy Planning Problem",
  "description": "A comprehensive energy planning decision for a mid-sized city (population 500,000) that needs to meet growing electricity demand while considering economic, environmental, and social factors. The city currently relies heavily on fossil fuels and wants to transition to a more sustainable energy mix by 2035. This problem involves selecting the optimal combination of energy sources to meet the projected 40% increase in energy demand over the next 10 years.",
